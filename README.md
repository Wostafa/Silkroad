## About This Project
This project is just for my portfolio. See live demo: https://silkroad.netlify.app  
The design is inspired by this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/967759864749832815).  
Uses Firebase and Netlify as a backend and Stripe for payments and Redux for state management.  
To test payment use card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242, a valid future date, such as 12/34 and any three-digit CVC.
